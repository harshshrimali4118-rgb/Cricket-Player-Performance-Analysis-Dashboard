# Cricket-Player-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard
Built an interactive Cricket Player Performance Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to analyze batting metrics such as runs, strike rate, averages, boundary %, and role-based comparisons for informed team selection and performance evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes T20 cricket player performance with a focus on Power Hitters and Openers. Python was used for data cleaning and feature engineering, and Power BI was used to build an interactive performance dashboard for data-driven player evaluation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate power hitters using multiple batting KPIs.
- Compare players based on Strike Rate vs Batting Average.
- Analyze consistency and match-by-match performance trends.
- Support role-based and strategy-driven player selection.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Power BI
- DAX
- Excel / CSV

## 📊 Key Metrics
- Total Runs
- Strike Rate
- Batting Average
- Boundary Percentage
